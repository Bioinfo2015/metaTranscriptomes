#RUNNING BEAST

#OBTAIN A NEXUS FILE OF SEQUENCES
#ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS WITH concatenate_genes_for_beast.py

#open the nexus file in BEAUti using File > import data

#The models are linked by default, so leave them linked for now (do not click Unlink Model or Subst. Clock or Trees)

#Tips Tab
	this is really only important when the time of sampling or extinction is a factor for terminal nodes like with viruses or fossils

#Site Model
	Substitution Model:
		best to pick this based on a model tester such as Jmodel
	Frequencies:
		estimate
	Site Heterogeneity Model:
		people usually use gamma
	Number of gamma categories:
		more than 4 is silly. People use 4
#clocks Tab
	Fixed clocks are silly. People only use them to disprove fixed is right
	Set to lognormal relaxed and click estimate
#Trees Tab
	For speciation use Yule or calibrated Yule depending on whether you got calibrations
	You can use Birth-Death if there are extinctions in your sample

#Now you can unlink all the partitions since the general model parameters have been set for all of them
#This will allow you to tweak them individually if you want

#Priors tab
	clades
		for any clade you assigned manually and have a divergence date estimate for, fill it in
		set initial value and mean as the target, and set the standard deviation to reflect the uncertainty in the estimate source
	kappa
		?
	frequencies
		?
	alpha
		?
	yule.birthRAte
		set this very loosely. Let the data drive what it becomes.
