#Tree file notes

# when using branch-specific codon models (model = 2 or 3 for codonml)--ie trying to get lineage specific rates, you need to label branches in the tree
#Branch labels are specified in the same way as branch lengths except that the symbol “#” is used rather than “:”

#here the branch leading to human and gibbon clade is labeled so that it will be assigned its own (W1) dN/dS
#all other branches will be assigned the 'background' (Wo) dN/dS.
((Hsa_Human, Hla_gibbon) #1, ((Cgu/Can_colobus, Pne_langur), Mmu_rhesus), (Ssc_squirrelM, Cja_marmoset));

#here are two equivalent ways of labeling all branches within the rabbit-rat clade
(((rabbit, rat) $1, human), goat_cow, marsupial);
(((rabbit #1, rat #1) #1, human), goat_cow, marsupial);


#note that node labels are positioned in same place as bootstrap values, so when adding them you will have to delete the bootstraps

#add the labels in to the tree manually. You can see if you did it right by opening it in dendroscope
