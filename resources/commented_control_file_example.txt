*branch models good for getting differences in mutation rates between lineages
*using branch models:
	*set model = 1  -- free ratios model assumes an independent value for dN/dS for each branch, this is discouraged (paml manual page 29)
	*set model = 2 -- allows 2 or more W ratios. To have these assigned you must label the branches that you want to calculate it for (see Tree file Notes)
*siteModels are for comparing rates between sites (among codons or amino acids in the protein). You'd want to do this if you're studying a particular gene/protein.
	*there are several site models. When searching for genes under selection, we probably want model MO (NSsites = 0) (PAML_tree_tutorial.pdf Nicholas R. Meyerson)
*branch-site models
	*these are when you want to find particular sites under selection in particular lineages

        noisy = 0   * 0,1,2,3,9: how much rubbish on the screen

                    *tree is needed if you use runmode = 0 or 1 (paml manual page 15)
                    *recommended to use 0 whereever possible (paml manual page 19)

                    * models for branches:
                        *0 gives one W ratio for all branches
                        *1 lets each branch have its own W -- parameter heavy and discouraged
                        *2 allows 2 or more dN/dS ratios for branches that you assign in the tree. The rest get the fixed 'background' Wo
                        *recommend using 2 for lineage specific questions

        kappa = 2   * initial or fixed kappa
    fix_omega = 0   * 1: omega or omega_1 fixed, 0: estimate
        omega = 1   * initial or fixed omega, for codons or codon-transltd AAs

    fix_alpha = 1   * 0: estimate gamma shape parameter; 1: fix it at alpha
        alpha = 0  * initial or fixed alpha, 0:infinity (constant rate)

 RateAncestor = 0   * (1/0): rates (alpha>0) or ancestral states (alpha=0)
       method = 0   * 0: simultaneous; 1: one branch at a time

#-------------------- HYPOTHESIS TESTING ---------------------------
#I want to find genes among all my orthologs that show significantly greater dN/dS in the Acroporid lineage than everywhere else
#NULL HYPOTHESIS: dN/dS ratios are the same for gene X across all lineages
#ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS: dN/dS ratios are greater in the Acroporid lineage than all others

#To test these, I need to compare the fit of two models, one that represents the null and one that represents the alternative
#for the null model use model = 0 in the control file; ie. assume that dN/dS is equal accross all lineages
#The model for the alternative hypothesis set model = 2 in the control file; ie dN/dS in the Acroporid lineage (the 'forground' dN/dS; this must be assigned with #1s or $1 in the tree file) is higher
#For now we are doing just a branch model (rather than a site-branch) because my focus is entire genes, not particular sites within genes
