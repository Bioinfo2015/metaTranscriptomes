These are several ortholog tables generated based on reciprocal best blastp hits.
The blasts were performed on extracted and translated coding sequences from transcriptomic data.
Extraction of coding sequences was performed using 'CDS_extractor_v2.pl' which 
is part of the Matz Annotation pipeline and can be found here: https://github.com/z0on/annotatingTranscriptomes


The different files differ in the stringency of the filters used to generated them.

Filtering parameters are included in the file names:
cov75--indicates that only blast hits with alignment lengths covering 75% of the hit sequence were retained
pctID75--indicates that only blast hits with > 75% hit identity were retained
rep0.8--indicates only orhtologous groups with > 80% representation among the included species were retained
All were generated using an e-value cutoff of 1e-5.


FileName:										Notes:
reciprocalOrthos_cov75_pctID75_rep0.8.txt		most stringent table. This was used for phylogeny construction and includes mostly highly expressed highly conserved sequences	
reciprocalOrthos_cov75_pctID10_rep0.15.txt		pctID10 is so low that the e-value filter is solely responsible for identity filtering
reciprocalOrthos_cov75_pctID75_rep0.1.txt		retains all orthologous groups with at least one pair of reciprocal best hitting sequences
