These are the files used to run the branch-site test for 
positive selection for orthologous sequences based on 
contig c015579 from the A. millepora transcriptome.
This was randomly selection from the set of contigs 
annotated as ribosomal. The files include:
	The tree file                                     - c015579.tree
	The codon alignment file                          - c015579.codon
	The codeml control file for the null model        - c015579_NULL.cnt
	The codeml control file for the alternative model - c015579_ALT.cnt
	The codeml output file for the null model         - c015579_NULL.codeml
	The codeml output file for the alternative model  - c015579_ALT.codeml
