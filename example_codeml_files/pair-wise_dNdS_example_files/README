These are example files required to run pair-wise
dNdS estimates for orthologous sequences based on
contig c004922 in the A.millepora transcriptome. 
They include:
	The tree file            - c004922.tree
	The codon alignment file - c004922.codon
	The codeml control file  - c004922.cnt
	The codeml output file   - c004922.codeml
